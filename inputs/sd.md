Précis of Cognitive Gadgets: The Cultural Evolution of Thinking

Abstract
Cognitive gadgets are distinctively human cognitive mechanisms – such as imitation, mind
reading, and language – that have been shaped by cultural rather than genetic evolution.
New gadgets emerge, not by genetic mutation, but by innovations in cognitive development;
they are specialised cognitive mechanisms built by general cognitive mechanisms using
information from the sociocultural environment. Innovations are passed on to subsequent
generations, not by DNA replication, but through social learning: People with new cognitive
mechanisms pass them on to others through social interaction. Some of the new mechanisms,
like literacy, have spread through human populations, while others have died out, because the
holders had more students, not just more babies. The cognitive gadgets hypothesis is
developed through four case studies, drawing on evidence from comparative and
developmental psychology, experimental psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. The
framework employed – cultural evolutionary psychology, a descendant of evolutionary
psychology and cultural evolutionary theory – addresses parallel issues across the cognitive
and behavioural sciences. In common with evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo)
and the extended evolutionary synthesis, cultural evolutionary psychology underlines the
importance of developmental processes and environmental factors in the emergence of
human cognition. In common with computational approaches (deep learning, predictive
coding, hierarchical reinforcement learning, causal modelling), it emphasises the power of
general-purpose mechanisms of learning. Cultural evolutionary psychology, however, also
challenges use of the behavioural gambit in economics and behavioural ecology, and rejects
the view that human minds are composed of “innate modules” or “cognitive instincts.”
